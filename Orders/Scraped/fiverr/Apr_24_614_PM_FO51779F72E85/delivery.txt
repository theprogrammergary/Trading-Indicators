Please read the disclaimer. Alright pretty sure I got it. It was a pain to add all the strategy stuff to the indicator (tracking open pnl and closed pnl, trade sizing etc).. Because of that anything other than minor minor tweaks I'll have to charge for.  I won't be around much this weekend (I might be able to respond or fix something small Sunday morning).
