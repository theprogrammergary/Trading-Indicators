1. Indicator w Alert and Lower Studies
-Make sure all inputs are right and matching each other.
-Have at least 30 days loaded or else messes with calculations. 
-Main chart cannot be more than the lower studies. For example if you switch the main chart to a daily chart, the lower 15min will not work. Once you switch back to a 15min chart or lower then the study will begin working again.
-Yellow label appears in top left when a trend change has occured in the last three bars. This matches the logic in the scan.

2. Scan
-I wouldn't change the inputs on the scans as I have the defaults set to 35 lookback, VALCU, and weighted. 
-If you want to ever change the times just message me
-The scan needs the 15,1hr,4hr,and D to be trending green. AND to have changed trend on the 5min in the last three bars.
