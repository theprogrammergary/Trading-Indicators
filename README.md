# Trading-Indicators

This repository features a mix of trading indicators from Thinkorswim, TradingView, and TradeStation Trading Platform. Within this collection, you'll find indicators that I've created as a freelancer for clients and some personal projects I have decided to open-source. There is a lot of what I would consider "junk" indicators for trading, but to each their own. As of December 2023, there are over 500 projects in here and nearly approaching 1k. You are free to do whatever you see fit with the source code provided. If you want to hire me to program your trading indicator or strategy please reach out to me via email at theprogrammergary@gmail.com.
