If we do any work in the future please be more explicit with what you want. This shouldn't of taken this long. I appreciate your business but it helps if both of us if you can be clear in what you want and not requesting changes that require code overhauling. If you arent sure with what you want tell me before we agree to a contract so i can factor that into pricing.

Again thank you for your business. Let me know if anything  needs tweaked here.
