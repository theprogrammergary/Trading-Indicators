Okay so I thought you could grab next earnings date from pinescript, but it seems tradingview doesn't have that feature yet. You can pull up previous earnings reports but they don't have the next date available. I am going to double check tomorrow, but if I cannot find a solution would you want anything else there to replace it?The next earnings date does show towards the bottom of the chart if you hover over it.
