1. Bull vs Bear
Tradestation requires separate study to color bars. 

To change the bar color you must go to inputs and use the RGB color creator. To create a new RGB color go to this website and select copy rgb values of your created color into tradestation.

The reason for this is that tradestations default colors are lacking and to plot things based on if statements it removes the ability to change the color the traditional way.
