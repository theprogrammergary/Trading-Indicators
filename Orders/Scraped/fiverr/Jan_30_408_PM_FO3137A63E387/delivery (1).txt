So I was correct the reasoning is tradingview auto combines afterhours data into daily data. Take a look at the screenshot.

green = yesterdays high
white = yesterdays close
red = yesterdays low


You can see where the arrows are at that yesterdays lows are different. On tradestation it is correct because it only uses market hours data. Tradingview uses both.


So you tell me what you want to do...
