[b]RVOL Overview[/b]
RVOL++ is a valuable tool for intraday traders to gauge market participation and anticipate the pace of the market. By understanding the RVOL levels, traders can adjust their strategies and expectations to align with the current market conditions. RVOL is a simple mathematical formula that compares the current volume to a prior lookback period, such as the previous 5 days or previous 10 days. This indicator helps traders understand the level of interest or participation in the market, which in turn can indicate the speed or pace of the market.

[b]How to calculate RVOL at Time[/b]

1. Check if the current time is within the specified time period (e.g., 9:30 AM to 5:00 PM EST).
   2.If it is, calculate the current cumulative volume for that period.
   3.Find the average cumulative volume for the same period over the past X days (where X is the lookback period).
   4.Calculate the RVOL at Time as:
   RVOL at Time =(Current Cumulative Volume/Average Cumulative Volume)Ã—100

[b]Key Features of RVOL++[/b]

- **Two Session and Daily Modes**: The RVOL++ indicator can operate in two modes - Two Session and Daily. In Two Session mode, it calculates RVOL for two distinct trading sessions, while in Daily mode, it calculates RVOL for the entire trading day. Two Session mode helps for instruments like futures, forex, crypto that trade 23+ hours.
- **Session Time Settings**: The indicator allows users to define the trading session times in Eastern Standard Time (EST) for more accurate RVOL calculations.
- **Customizable Lookback Period**: Users can set the number of days for the lookback period, allowing for flexibility in calculating the average volume at time (RVOL).
- **Color-Coded RVOL Histogram**: The indicator displays a color-coded histogram to visualize RVOL levels. Different colors represent different RVOL ranges, making it easy to identify low, neutral, and high RVOL periods.
- **RVOL Ranges**: The indicator defines RVOL ranges as follows:
  - 60 - 80: Low RVOL
  - 80 - 120: Neutral RVOL
  - 120+: High RVOL

[b]Low RVOL Environment[/b]

- Expect slow market movement with limited opportunities.
- Focus on A+ setups and be selective.
- Use tighter stops, size down, and adjust trading goals.
