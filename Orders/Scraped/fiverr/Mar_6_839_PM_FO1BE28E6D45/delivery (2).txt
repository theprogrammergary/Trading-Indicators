Please read the disclaimer.

I addressed the issues and believe it should be working how you like now. I added a coloring of the Higher timeframe moving averages so you can see what side we should be taking on the trade. Just import this again and install like the last video. When you import overwrite all.


Let me know if you need anything else!
