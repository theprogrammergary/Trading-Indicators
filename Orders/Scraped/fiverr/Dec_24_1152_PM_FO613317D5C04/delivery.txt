I went ahead and made two different scans for you.

1. This is exactly how you wanted it.

2. This is the same thing but there is a small change. It shows you last weeks scan. I included this just in case you wanted it as well.

-You add the study to the chart to visual see scan results on chart. See the pictures.
The two studies will be called:
RangeScan (for scan1)
RangeScan LastWeek (for scan2)

If you have any questions let me know. Thinkorswim has had problems with the links recently so if you get an error let me know.
