[b]Why is RTH Important?[/b]
Tracking the RTH session is important because often times the overnight session can be filled with "lies". It is thought that because the overnight session is lower volume price can be pushed or "manipulated" to extremes that would not happen during higher volume times.

[b]Why is the ON Session Important Then?[/b]
Just because the ON session can be thought as a "lie" doesn't mean it is relevant to know. For example, if price is stuck inside the ON range then you can think of the market as rotational or range-bound. If price is above the ON range then it can be thought of as bullish. If price is below the ON range then it can be thought as bearish.

[b]What is IB?[/b]
IB or initial balance is the first hour of the New York Session. Typically the market sets the tone for the day in the first hour. This tone is similarly a map like the ON session. If we are above the IBH then it is bullish and likely a trend day to the upside. If we are below the IBL then it is bearish and likely a trend day to the downside. If we are in IB then we want to avoid conducting business in the middle of IBH and IBL to avoid getting chopped up in a range bound market.

[b]These levels are not a holy grail[/b]
You should use this indicator as guide or map for context about the instrument you are trading. You need to combine your own technical analysis with this indicator. You want as much context confirming your trade thesis in order to enter a trade. Simply buying or selling because we are above or below a level is not recommended in any circumstance. If it were that easy I would not publish this indicator.

[b]Adjustments[/b]
In the indicator settings you can adjust the RTH, ON, and IB session-time settings. All of the times entered must be in EST (Eastern Standard Time). You may want to do this to apply the levels to a foreign market.
