Please read the disclaimer...No video. I was able to get it to work and through my shuffling through charts I've eliminated the error. The only thing is make sure you have enough days loaded on the chart to be able to see the trendlines. For example if you are looking for daily trendlines they are not going to show up on a 5d 5min chart. It will need at least 30d 5min or maybe more.LINK:https://tos.mx/TFpfglM
