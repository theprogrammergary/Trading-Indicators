Same logic for rsi just replace macd with rsi.TREND IS GREEN = high is greater than previous swing high or close is greater than current swing highTREND IS RED = low is less than previous swing low or close is less than current swing lowTREND IS YELLOW =  the last swing high was a lower high or the last swing low was higher lowMACD/RSI compute the same. You compare the colors of the price chart and the lower chart. If they dont match there is divergence.
