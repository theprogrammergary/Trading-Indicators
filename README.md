# Trading-Indicators

This repository features a mix of trading indicators from Thinkorswim, TradingView, and TradeStation Trading Platform. Within this collection, you'll find indicators that I've created as a freelancer for clients and some personal projects I have decided to open-source. There is a lot of what I would consider "junk" indicators for trading, but to each their own. You are free to do whatever you see fit with the source code provided. If you want to hire me to program your trading indicator or strategy please reach out to me via email at theprogrammergary@gmail.com.
